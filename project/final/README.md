# Project Documentation: The Fascination with JDM Cars

## Introduction

The topic I have selected for this project is **JDM Cars** (Japanese Domestic Market Cars). JDM cars are vehicles originally manufactured for the Japanese market, often featuring unique design elements, advanced technologies, and high-performance features that differ from international models. Over time, these cars have gained a significant following worldwide due to their reliability, innovative engineering, and cultural significance. JDM cars are not just vehicles; they represent a piece of automotive history and a symbol of Japanese craftsmanship. I chose this topic because of the global influence JDM cars have had on car culture, especially in the tuning, racing, and modification communities.

## Prompts Used

To gather relevant information on this topic, I used the following prompts:

- "What are JDM cars and how do they differ from international models?"
- "Why are JDM cars so popular in car culture worldwide?"
- "What makes JDM cars unique in terms of performance and design?"
- "What is the history behind the rise of JDM cars in the automotive world?"

The research based on these prompts helped me understand the significance of JDM cars in both the automotive industry and global car culture.

# Project Layout

## Layout Approach
- The page layout uses a combination of **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**.
- Flexbox was applied to the `body` to manage the overall page structure.
- The main content area is displayed using **CSS Grid** for a responsive, multi-column layout.
- Semantic HTML elements like `header`, `footer`, `section`, and `article` were used to ensure accessibility and proper structure.
